<h2 class="ui header">HOW TO USE THE WEATHER NORMALIZATION TOOL</h2>

<ol class="ui list">
	<li value="1)">Enter the  Information about your Building (e.g. name, location)</li>
	<li value="2)">Enter the name of the energy meter for which you wanter to assess weather sensitivity (for your records)</li>
	<li value="3)">Select the starting date of the range over which you want to analyze weather sensitivity.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">Note: It is important that the starting date is within the date range of your energy data CSV file.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="4)">Select the ending date of the range over which you want to analyze weather sensitivity.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">Note: It is important that the starting date is within the date range of your energy data CSV file. </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="5)">Select how you want to determine degree days.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">Average: Uses Daily Average Temperature to calculate degree days.</li>
			<li value="b.">Maximum: Uses Daily Max Temperature to calculate degree days.</li>
			<li value="c.">Minimum: Uses Daily Min Temperature to calculate degree days.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="6)">Enter the threshold for which you want to calculate degree days. The default is 65 Degrees Fahrenheit.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">Heating Degree Days (HDD) are computed by subtracting Daily Avg/Min/Max Temperatyre from the threshold (default: 65 Degrees). If the difference is < 0, HDD = 0 for that day. </li>
			<li value="c.">Cooling Degree Days (CDD) are computed by subtracting the threshold (default: 65 Degrees) from the Daily Avg/Min/Max Temperature. If the difference is < 0, CDD = 0 for that day. </li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="7)">Select the frequency of the energy data in your uploaded CSV.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">The frequency of the data can be either daily or monthly</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="8)">Select the Days of Week for which you want to perform the analysis.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">Your building may be operated differently on certain days of the week. For instance, weekends might not be occupied
			and so you might want to just analyze weather sensitivity of your weekday (M,Tu,W,Th,F) energy consumption.</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="9)">Upload your CSV making sure that it is in the correct format.
		<ol>
			<li value="a.">If your CSV is not in the correct format, then the analysis will not work!</li>
		</ol>
	</li>
	<li value="10)"> Click 'Get Results' and see a plot of your building's weather sensitivity! </li>
</ol>
