# This is the main configuration file for the application.
# ~~~~~

# Secret key
# ~~~~~
# The secret key is used to secure cryptographics functions.
# If you deploy your application to several instances be sure to use the same key!
# TODO Generate a secret for your app using `sbt playGenerateSecret` and pass it via -Dplay.crypto.secret
play.crypto.secret="changeme" # -> will crash app on startup in prod mode
# Uncomment this line if you want to set secret via environment vars
# play.crypto.secret=${?APPLICATION_SECRET}

# The application languages
# ~~~~~
play.i18n.langs=["en"]

# Application loader class
# ~~~~~
play.application.loader="AppLoader"

# Router
# ~~~~~
# Define the Router object to use for this application.
# This router will be looked up first when the application is starting up,
# so make sure this is the entry point.
# Furthermore, it's assumed your route file is named properly.
# So for an application router like `my.application.Router`,
# you may need to define a router file `conf/my.application.routes`.
# Default to Routes in the root package (and conf/routes)
# application.router=my.application.Routes

# Database configuration
# ~~~~~
# You can declare as many datasources as you want.
# By convention, the default datasource is named `default`
#
# db.default.driver=org.h2.Driver
# db.default.url="jdbc:h2:mem:play"
# db.default.user=sa
# db.default.password=""

# Evolutions
# ~~~~~
# You can disable evolutions if needed
# evolutionplugin=disabled
